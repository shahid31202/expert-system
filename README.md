# expert-system
In this project we store the details of patients who take treatment in our expert system. We also ask questions based to the patients. Based on their answers our expert system will recognise the disease they are suffering from and also prescribe a medicine for that disease. We also store the details of the patient who are diagnosed by our expert system. We also used constraint satisfaction for the patient name and their age which should only be a string and number. We create two files in python one is questions.txt for generating questions and another one is patients.txt for storing the details of the patient. We used python3 for implementation of this code and for this project we use some techniques for finding the disease which are they suffering from and medicines prescribed. Inference engine generates questions that are present in questions.txt. Knowledge base analyses the situation of the patient and prescribes medicine along with dosage.
